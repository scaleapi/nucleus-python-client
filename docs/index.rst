Welcome to the Nucleus API Reference!
=====================================

Aggregate metrics in ML are not good enough. To improve production ML, you need to understand qualitative failure modes, fix them by gathering more data, and curate diverse scenarios.

Scale Nucleus helps you:

* Visualize your data
* Curate interesting slices within your dataset
* Review and manage annotations
* Measure and debug your model performance

Nucleus is a new way—the right way—to develop ML models, helping us move away from the concept of one dataset and towards a paradigm of collections of scenarios.
